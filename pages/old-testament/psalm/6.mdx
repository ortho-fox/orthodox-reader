1. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure.

2. Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I am weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled.

3. My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O LORD--how long?

4. Return, O LORD, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake!

5. For in death there is no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks?

6. I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears.

7. My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies.

8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping.

9. The LORD has heard my supplication; The LORD will receive my prayer.

10. Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back and be ashamed suddenly.
