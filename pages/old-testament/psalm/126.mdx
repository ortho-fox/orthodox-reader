1. When the LORD brought back the captivity of Zion, We were like those who dream.

2. Then our mouth was filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing. Then they said among the nations, "The LORD has done great things for them."

3. The LORD has done great things for us, And we are glad.

4. Bring back our captivity, O LORD, As the streams in the South.

5. Those who sow in tears Shall reap in joy.

6. He who continually goes forth weeping, Bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, Bringing his sheaves with him.
