1. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?

2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me?

3. Consider and hear me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the sleep of death;

4. Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him"; Lest those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

5. But I have trusted in Your mercy; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.

6. I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
